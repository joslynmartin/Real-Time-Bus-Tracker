# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

## Description
To allow this program to run, download all of the files in this repository and drag your index.html file onto a web browser. You should see a map with a marker at MIT. At your pleasure, you can start the program and watch the marker move through all of the bus stops to Harvard.

## Future Improvements
Adding more design to the map and the marker would take this project to a new level and make it more aesthetically pleasing. I plan to create a button for it that allows you to switch through a few different cities and bus routes.

## License
The MIT license is attached in this repository.
